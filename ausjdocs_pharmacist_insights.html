        <!-- CONTEXT BOX -->
        <div class="context-box">
            <p><strong>Hey r/ausjdocs!</strong> I'm a pharmacy resident and wanted to understand what junior doctors actually think of hospital pharmacists—not the filtered feedback we get in person, but the real discussions.</p>
            
            <p>So I scraped posts from this subreddit from <strong>September 2022 to November 2025</strong>, focusing specifically on hospital pharmacy collaboration. Had to sift through A LOT of scope creep discussions (you guys really made your point there 😅), but found 4 posts with <strong>147 comments</strong> that were specifically about working with hospital pharmacists day-to-day. Reddit CommentScrapper scripts on github </p>
            
            <p>This is my analysis of what you said. Thought I'd close the loop and share it back—figured you might be curious what patterns emerged from your own discussions.</p>

            <h3>⚠️ Limitations & Methodology Notes</h3>
            <p><strong>Transparency first:</strong> This analysis has limitations you should know about:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Selection bias:</strong> Only analyzed 4 posts specifically about hospital pharmacy (excluded the many scope creep policy posts)</li>
                <li><strong>Platform bias:</strong> The r/ausjdocs community is heterogeneous and includes senior doctors, allied health professionals and others.</li>
                <li><strong>Analyst bias:</strong> I'm a pharmacist analyzing comments about pharmacists—I've tried to present findings neutrally, but my perspective shapes interpretation</li>
                <li><strong>Upvotes as validation:</strong> Using upvotes to indicate agreement/resonance with the community, but not everyone votes</li>
                <li><strong>Qualitative method:</strong> Thematic analysis, not statistics—themes identified through reading and pattern recognition</li>
                <li><strong>Jurisdictional Variation:</strong> Differences in prescribing legislation and pharmacy practice across Australian states</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With those caveats: here's what I found.</p>

        <!-- MAIN FINDINGS SUMMARY -->
        <div class="findings-summary">
            <strong>MAIN PATTERNS IDENTIFIED:</strong> Comments showed both appreciation and frustration with hospital pharmacists. Positive sentiment appeared more frequently (approximately 5:1 ratio based on upvotes and comment content). The most upvoted comments emphasized patient safety value, while frustrations centered on communication tone and clinical boundary questions.

                    <p>Complex or unconventional prescribing often prompts pharmacists to seek clarification. This can be part of the learning process for junior pharmacists, who gradually become familiar with the nuances of that specialty and, at times, the prescribing styles of individual consultants.</p>

                    <p>One of the original posts was from a pharmacist asking if GPs minded being called about dose errors. The responses were clear:</p>

                        <div class="quote-text">"I often need to call the GP to get permission to change the dose to a safe, appropriate dose. Most of the time it's clear that the GP accidentally put an increased dose on when they didn't mean to. The GPs usually are nice about it and then hang up as soon as I say thank you that's all. Which implies they are very busy. But do GPs mind that pharmacists call them up for something seemingly simple like that? I do feel awkward calling GPs to fix the script."</div>

                        <div class="quote-text">"Do a good medicines reconciliation with patients on admission. Its hard for doctors to have the time to go to 3 different sources and cross reference them and check with the patient/family what they are actually taking, especially when they are admitted out of hours and GP/pharmacy etc is closed. Sometimes JMO admitting them is actually cross covering another team and has never worked on a gastro ward etc so might have limited knowledge of the 'normal meds' for that patient group."</div>

                    <h3>The Pattern</h3>
                    <p>Several comments referenced timing of pharmacy interventions, particularly around discharge:</p>

                    <div class="quote">
                        <div class="quote-text">"All of this, especially 'in a timely manner'. Patients being discharged having to wait for scripts/meds can significantly affect bed flow. I would add, letting the drs know if something is not available and what an alternative may be. Especially with recent drug shortages in the community. Im sure you understand the frustrations for patients if the drug isn't actually available, and for staff. Being an emergency physician and getting a call from the community from/about a patient I don't know, who has been discharged from a ward stay, needing a different script because the med isn't available and its now after hours, and is it important, and if not you, then who, because the treating team has all gone home and no one else is answering their phone."</div>

                    <p>One sarcastic comment indicated late discharge scripts are a recognized issue:</p>

                    <div class="quote">
                        <div class="quote-text">"Ok, 7 discharge scripts at 4:58 pm it is then /s"</div>

                    </div>

                    <p>A pharmacist response acknowledged system constraints:</p>

                    <div class="quote">
                        <div class="quote-text">"I'd image the ward pharmacists are already trying to do things as quickly as possible. But sometimes there's something on the script that needs to be fixed, and they have to get someone to fix it.

                    <h3>What This Suggests</h3>
                    <p>Discharge medication delays have workflow impacts. After-hours problems from poor discharge planning affect ED physicians. Drug shortage communication needs to happen proactively.</p>
